- Consistent schema compliance and data formatting
- High accuracy across all tested research domains
- Effective handling of multiple data types (financial, scientific, legal, media, AI/ML)
- Excellent performance across simple and complex structured data
- **Highly responsive to clear instruction requirements** - specifying count minimums resolves coverage issues

**Key Limitations:**
- Requires explicit instruction clarity for comprehensive dataset coverage
- Initial results may be incomplete without specific count requirements

**Key Discovery:**
Instruction optimization with specific count requirements (min/max) achieved 100% success rate, converting 4 initially incomplete tests to full successes. This demonstrates that the API is capable of handling even specialized domains like AI benchmarks when given precise guidance.

The test suite successfully validates the API's comprehensive capabilities while demonstrating the critical importance of precise instruction formulation for optimal results.
