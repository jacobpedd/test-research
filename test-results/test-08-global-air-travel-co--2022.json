    "methodology": "The estimate of total global CO2 emissions from commercial aviation in 2022 is derived from multiple authoritative sources. According to the European Commission's climate action data, aviation emissions for 2022 reached almost 800 million tonnes of CO2, which is about 80% of pre-pandemic levels. Our World in Data and the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) provide consistent figures, with ATAG reporting around 882 million tonnes of CO2 in 2023, indicating that 2022 emissions were slightly lower but close to this value. For the share of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that total global CO2 emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes in 2022 were approximately 36.8 billion tonnes. Using these figures, commercial aviation's share of global CO2 emissions in 2022 is estimated at roughly 2.2% to 2.3%. The methodology involves cross-referencing reported aviation CO2 emissions with total global anthropogenic CO2 emissions from energy and industrial sources to calculate the percentage share. This approach ensures consistency by using data from recognized international organizations and industry groups, providing a reliable estimate of aviation's contribution to global CO2 emissions in 2022.",
